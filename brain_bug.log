# Project: Codey No Mercy EDITION — Refactor & Debug Session
# Devs:    VolkanSah (The Architect) + Claude (The Rubber-Duck)
# Status:  "Wallah" Branch merged & bugs smashed
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
[SESSION_START]
# Objective: Merge "Baby-Code" (Commits/Streak) with "Brutal-Code" (Everything else).
# Challenge: Fix logic loops and API-blindness.
[BUG_01] STREAK_DOUBLE_PENALTY
# Symptom:  Streak decayed at 2x speed. Codey was dying for no reason.
# Cause:    Redundant logic. 'calculate_skill_decay()' AND 'update_brutal_stats()' 
#           were both decrementing the streak counter simultaneously.
# Fix:      Removed streak manipulation from 'calculate_skill_decay()'. 
#           Streak is now exclusively handled by 'update_brutal_stats()'.
# Note:     Overlooked for months. Gravity is a bitch.
[BUG_02] WEEKEND_BONUS_INFLATION
# Symptom:  Levels spiking too fast; 'total_commits' was artificial.
# Cause:    The weekend multiplier was applied to 'daily_activity' BEFORE
#           adding it to the 'total_commits' counter.
# Fix:      Passed 'raw_commits' separately. Bonuses now apply only to XP
#           and rewards, keeping the historical commit count honest.
# Verdict:  Shared guilt between Human and AI.
[BUG_03] THE_SILENT_COMMIT_CRASH
# Symptom:  Daily_commits = 0. Streak never triggered.
# Cause:    Refactor swapped '/repos/{repo}/commits' for 'Events API'.
#           Events API is blind to private/org commits.
# Fix:      Hybrid approach: Use Events API for speed, fallback to direct 
#           Commit API for the full truth.
# Verdict:  Claude broke the "Baby-Code". Fixed by Volkan.
[NEW_FEATURES]
# - Advanced Issue Analysis:
#   * Open/Close ratio tracking.
#   * Keyword scoring (Bugs/Features = +XP | 'asdf' = Trash/Penalty).
#   * XP_PER_ISSUE_CLOSED set to 8.
# - Achievement Unlocked: 🐛 Bug Slayer.
# - UI: Added 'issue_line' to the SVG footer.
[DESIGN_DECISIONS]
# - No Private/Orga Repos: Prevents stat padding through hidden noise.
# - No PRs: Weak signal for solo devs.
# - Issues = High Signal: Represents maintenance and responsibility.
# - Codey Goal: An unfakeable quality seal in the "Dead Internet" era.

# Jurisdiction: Berlin, Germany (StGB §202a/b/c - Don't touch, it bites!)
# Copyright:    VolkanSah & BadTin & The Cats 🐱
[ROADMAP_NEXT]
# 1. GitLab & HuggingFace integration.
# 2. Integrate 'brain_bug.log' as a core feature.
# 3. Traffic API: Clone/Star ratio analysis.
# 4. ESOL v1.2: Explicit anti-reputation-manipulation clauses.
[SESSION_END]
# Status:  Commits visible. Streak recovery pending check.
# Summary: We aren't stupid, but the bugs were definitely "No Mercy".

# Project: Codey-LAB — Architecture, Philosophy & Prompt Engineering
# Devs:    VolkanSah (The Architect) + Claude (The Sidekick)
# Status:  No bugs smashed. Pure vision locked in.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
[SESSION_START]
# Objective: Define Codey-LAB identity, anti-fraud doctrine, and universal LLM prompt.
# Challenge: Translate a 42-year-old senior dev's vision into files a community can use.
[DELIVERABLE_01] UNIVERSAL_SENIOR_DEV_PROMPT
# Symptom:  Every LLM produces datamüll by default. Token costs real money.
# Cause:    Models trained on "helpful = verbose". No operator correction.
# Fix:      SENIOR_DEV_ASSISTANT.md v0.2 — universal system prompt, all major models.
#           Mode system: [MODE: REVIEW] [MODE: DEBUG] [MODE: ARCH] [MODE: FAST] [MODE: SEC]
#           Anti-noise rules, repo context handling, token efficiency as contract.
# Verdict:  Gemini still produced 6 pages. Prompt v0.3 will show no mercy.
[DELIVERABLE_02] CODEY_LAB_ORG_README
# Symptom:  Codey-LAB had no public face. Empty org. No door policy.
# Cause:    Vision existed in founder's head only.
# Fix:      .github/profile/README.md — VIP club framing, Codey as gatekeeper,
#           Wall of Shames as allied org, level system as verification not gamification.
#           "A dead pet doesn't lie." — anti-scammer core in one sentence.
# Note:     Emoji in headings kill the charm. Fixed after founder feedback.
#           GitHub's cmark-gfm renders chaos. We respect it and move on.
[DELIVERABLE_03] ANTI_FRAUD_PHILOSOPHY
# Symptom:  Codey-LAB had no documented reason to exist beyond "cool prompts".
# Cause:    The real mission — protecting next-gen devs from AI fraud — was unwritten.
# Fix:      PHILOSOPHY.md v2 — Heart/Brain/Skin doctrine, full scam lifecycle,
#           Wall of Shames as social media hunters, Codey-LAB as inoculation.
#           Scope: not just hacking scams. All AI fraud. TikTok to Telegram.
# Verdict:  "Make $5000/month with AI" = same code, different victim. Documented.
[DESIGN_DECISIONS]
# - Codey is not a badge. Codey is the door.
# - No Codey running = Level 0. Always. No exceptions. No appeals.
# - Apache 2.0 + ESOL v1.1 everywhere. MIT was a mistake. Corrected.
# - Prompt always EN. Response mirrors user language. Non-negotiable.
# - Wall of Shames = hunters. Codey-LAB = cure. Same team, two weapons.
# - brain_bug.log is now a Codey-LAB core feature. Sessions become history.

[ROADMAP_NEXT]
# 1. Push .github repo to Codey-LAB org — public, cache will clear.
# 2. Prompt v0.3 — Gemini gets no mercy.
# 3. Heart/Brain/Skin — SVG heartbeat, brain score, full skin system.
# 4. Level-gated content — rewards unlock with real Codey metrics.
# 5. ESOL v1.2 — anti-reputation-manipulation clauses.
[SESSION_END]
# Status:  Three production-ready files. Zero bugs. Foundation locked.
# Summary: The lab has a name, a face, a door, and a reason to exist.
#          Codey watches the commits. The philosophy watches the vision.
#          The prompt watches the tokens.
