# üêæ Codey (Lite) - Your Personal GitHub Pet

A fun little script that turns your GitHub activity into a digital pet! **Codey** is a project that updates daily based on your commits and merged pull requests, reflecting your coding journey in a cute, animated SVG badge.

## Example: 
![Codey - Your GitHub Pet](codey.svg)


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Lite version was the initial concept, but I've stopped its development to rebuild the project from scratch. This new logic allows for the full range of features.
> For the best experience, please use Codey [The Full RPG Experience](https://github.com/VolkanSah/Codey/).

## üöÄ How to Use Codey in Your Own Repository

You can easily add Codey to your profile or any of your project's `README.md` files.

### 1. Set Up the Workflow

* Copy the `update_codey.py` script and the `.github/workflows/update_codey.yml` file into your own repository.

### 2. Configure Your Tracking Mode

The script uses the `GIT_REPOSITORY` environment variable to determine what to track. Add this variable to your workflow's `env` section.

#### Option A: Track a Single Repository

To track a specific repository, set the value to `owner/repo`.

```yaml
env:
  GIT_REPOSITORY: 'YourUsername/YourProject'
````

#### Option B: Track Your Entire Account

To aggregate commits and merged PRs across all repositories you own, simply provide your username.

```yaml
env:
  GIT_REPOSITORY: 'YourUsername'
```

*Note: For the script to access private repositories, you must use a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `repo` permissions.*

### 3\. Add the Badge to Your README

Once the workflow is set up and has run at least once, `codey.svg` and `codey.json` will be generated in your repository. You can then add the following Markdown to your `README.md` to display your personal Codey\!

```markdown
![Codey - Your GitHub Pet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/main/codey.svg)
```

*Remember to replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPO` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.*
